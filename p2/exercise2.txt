For rgb images, the plot of each individual image only shows the saturation of
the image in each color, but not exactly that color.
for hsv image, the value image has clear shape of the original, since that image
has the color information of the image. Saturation is more about how intense is
each colror. Hue is more showing the side of color that the pixel belongs to.
For YCrCb image, y is the luma of the image, therefore, it has the shape info
of the original image, cr and cb shows more the different between color, which 
is blurry by plotting individually. The closer the color, the blurrier the image
becomes.
